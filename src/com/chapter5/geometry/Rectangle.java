 * that encloses the current object and the rectangle passed as an argument, and a method to display
 * the defining points of a rectangle. Test the class by creating four rectangles and combining
 * these cumulatively to end up with a rectangle enclosing them all. Output the defining points of
 * all the rectangles you create.
